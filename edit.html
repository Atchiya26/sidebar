            <p><b style="font-size:100px;">We understand it takes a lot of time for authors, editors and proof-readers to check references, format them and make sure a manuscript meets a targeted book/journal style. We use customized journal/book-specific rules to format references; cross-reference citations, tables, equations and figures, global changes, etc.; and raise necessary queries to the authors/copyeditors on concerns that need further analysis. The process saves a lot of time for the copyeditors, who can then concentrate on other aspects of the editing job</b></p>
